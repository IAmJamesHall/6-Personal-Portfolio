          p I've always been thrilled by computers. Typing in some code and watching the screen light up just seemed like magic. I learned <a href="https://www.justbasic.com/">BASIC</a> when I was about 7, and HTML 3 soon after. 
          p But I've come a long way since then. Last year I researched the best way to learn to code professionally, and I settled upon <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home">Treehouse</a>. They guide complete beginners to professional level. One of the parts that I really like is that they stress peer reviews. When I've completed a project, one of my peers reviews it and gives me written feedback. Conversely, I give peer reviews to my fellow students as well. This teaches me how to take feedback, and how to read & understand others' code.
          p Whether I'm debugging someone else's code or solving my own problems, coding is a lot of fun, and I enjoy the challenges it offers. I'm always up to learn a new language feature or aspect.
